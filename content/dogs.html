		<p>An Assistance Dog is the same breed, age and temperament as a guide dog.  It is trained specially to work with an autistic child and his/her family and as with a guide dog has unlimited access to public places such as shops, restaurants, cinema etc.</p>
		<p>The main function of the dog is to help keep the child safe  but many parents also report other benefits such as improvement in the child's behaviour due to the interaction between the child and dog and the reassurance of the dog's presence</p>
		<p>Autism assistance dogs are known to:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Increase safety levels and alleviate the bolting behaviours by acting as an anchor when tethered to the child</li>
		<li>Provide independence as the child doesn't have to hold the parents hand</li>
		<li>Provide greater freedom to go out in public due to the calming affects the dog has on the child</li>
		<li>Help with transitioning which leads to reduced stress levels and a more positive experience for all</li>
		<li>Act as a constant companion, offering unconditional love and friendship</li>
	  	<li>Improve socialisation skills</li>
	</ul>
